Usage instructions:
1. Connect a CAN adapter to this computer. Supported adapters are:
1.1. SLCAN-compliant adapters. If you're using an SLCAN adapter,
     use its serial port name as a CAN interface name (e.g. "/dev/ttyACM0").
1.2. SocketCAN-compatible adapters. In this case it is recommended to use
     8devices USB2CAN. The correct interface name would be "can0".
2. Connect exactly one DroneCode Probe to this computer.
   For more info refer to https://kb.zubax.com/x/iIAh.
3. Follow the instructions printed in green. If you have any questions,
   don't hesitate to reach licensing@zubax.com, or use the emergency
   contacts provided to you earlier.
